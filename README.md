# Installation

## Install Docker Containers
First, download the Docker Community Edition (CE) for the Desktop from their [download page](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download).

Secondly, follow their instructions at their [Getting Started Page](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/).

If you want [hands-on tutorials](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) or would like to use their [training videos and online playground](http://training.play-with-docker.com/), please feel free to do so.

### Docker Cheat Sheet
Here is a simple [Docker Cheat Sheet](https://www.docker.com/sites/default/files/Docker_CheatSheet_08.09.2016_0.pdf) provided by Docker in case you're unfamiliar with the commands.

### Linux Cheat Sheet
Here is a [Linux/Unix Commands Reference](https://files.fosswire.com/2007/08/fwunixref.pdf) in case you're unfamiliar with the system as we will be using a Docker Linux Container with Ubuntu.
